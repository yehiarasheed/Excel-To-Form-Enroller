# Excel To Form Enroller
## Project Description
Automating student enrollment involves extracting data from Excel files and seamlessly populating Google Forms for each individual student, including data validation. The end goal is to reduce the processing time per item by 80% and achieve better monitoring of overall activity using the logs provided by the robots.

 Validations include checking whether the Excel file exists, has at least one non-empty row, if the form exists in the given link, and whether a certain student record has missing information.

 Kindly find the PDD (Process Definition Document) and the Excel File in the Folder `Additional Files`.
