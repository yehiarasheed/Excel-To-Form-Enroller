# Excel To Form Enroller
## Project Description
Automating student enrollment involves extracting data from Excel files and seamlessly populating Google Forms for each individual student, including data validation. The end goal is **to reduce the processing time per item by 80% and achieve better monitoring of overall activity using the logs provided by the robots.**

 Validations include checking whether the Excel file exists, has at least one non-empty row, if the form exists in the given link, and whether a certain student record has missing information.

 You'll find the PDD (Process Definition Document) and 2 versions of the Excel File, the complete version and another one that tests for validations in the  `Additional Files` Folder.
